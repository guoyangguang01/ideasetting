      <item value="In order to avoid version conflicts, the dependencies can be shaded and packaged within the client in a single JAR file (sometimes called an &quot;uber JAR&quot; or &quot;fat JAR&quot;). Shading a dependency consists of taking its content (resources files and Java class files) and renaming some of its packages before putting them in the same JAR file as the low-level Java REST client. Shading a JAR can be accomplished by 3rd-party plugins for Gradle and Maven." />
